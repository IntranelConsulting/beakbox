          My macaw absolutely loves his BeakBox. It gives him something interesting to do whilst I'm away from him and it enables me to really stimulate his cage play in different ways. Super easy to
          set up/down and virtually bombproof if set up correctly. My boy goes nuts trying to switch between the different sounds and it keeps him amused for ages! Highly recommend this gadget for any
          sized bird; they'll thank you for it. 😂

          This toy allows your bird to entertain themselves while you're out!! Need I say more?? You can program any songs, recordings, bird sounds, anything you like!! It's also extremely easy for
          the bird to learn to use it! Not only is this an amazing bird toy, but the work the creators put in the toy's design is absolutely stunning. This product is a beautiful, functional piece of
          art you and your bird will both enjoy! Their eyes light up when they pull the lever and a different song starts playing. I also must say that the creators is incredibly kind. Their customer
          service is like nothing I've ever experienced. I truly love this company and you should too. My birds love their beak box!!

          I recently ordered a large BeakBox for my African Grey Congo and it is an amazing device. Within a short timeframe we ordered a second large one for my Timneh. We just got the second one and
          we will be installing it in his cage tomorrow. Now I am waiting for the minis to restock. I plan on getting two minis for my greencheek conures. All bird toys should have this kind of
          stimulation. Wonderfully manufactured! Great Entertainment! We absolutely love them! Amazing job!

          Great toy for birds who may be bored while their owners are away. The toy is simple to use and not intimidating. The best part is adding your own music for your birds to listen to. Easy set
          up and plug in which is a plus!

          Saro can be a little bit of a wildcard with guests, so we like to have people who are just getting to know her train her while she's in the cage until they've established trust and she's
          accepted them into the flock. I trained her to turn on the BeakBox for a reward, and it's a favorite activity with visitors to have them train her using the BeakBox! Once we started to
          self-isolate during the pandemic and were home more often, the BeakBox became a way for her to communicate with us without having to scream. When she wants her cage opened up or to start a
          training session, she'll start a song and I'll come over to give her a little bit of attention. It's a much more pleasant way of her communicating her needs than yelling for us!

          The beakbox has been so fun to introduce our bird to. Its such a different type of toy for her to be able to activate and play with. We have it near one of her favorite foraging toys and its
          fun to see her start some jams and then go back to foraging.
