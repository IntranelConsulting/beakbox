      <h2>Music at a push of a lever</h2>
      <p>
        BeakBox plays music every time your parrot pulls or pushes a beak-resistant lever. How cool is that? Simply upload your parrot’s favourite music onto the MicroSD card that comes with your
        BeakBox, install BeakBox on your parrot cage, plug it in, and enjoy the show!

        <h3>Clever little boredom breaker</h3>
        <p>
          My macaw absolutely loves his BeakBox. It gives him something interesting to do whilst I'm away from him and it enables me to really stimulate his cage play in different ways. Super easy to
          set up/down and virtually bombproof if set up correctly. My boy goes nuts trying to switch between the different sounds and it keeps him amused for ages! Highly recommend this gadget for any
          sized bird; they'll thank you for it. 😂

        <h3>Brilliant bird toy and a gorgeous product!!</h3>
        <p>
          This toy allows your bird to entertain themselves while you're out!! Need I say more?? You can program any songs, recordings, bird sounds, anything you like!! It's also extremely easy for
          the bird to learn to use it! Not only is this an amazing bird toy, but the work the creators put in the toy's design is absolutely stunning. This product is a beautiful, functional piece of
          art you and your bird will both enjoy! Their eyes light up when they pull the lever and a different song starts playing. I also must say that the creators is incredibly kind. Their customer
          service is like nothing I've ever experienced. I truly love this company and you should too. My birds love their BeakBox!!

        <h3>Excellent</h3>
        <p>
          I recently ordered a large BeakBox for my African Grey Congo and it is an amazing device. Within a short timeframe we ordered a second large one for my Timneh. We just got the second one and
          we will be installing it in his cage tomorrow. Now I am waiting for the minis to restock. I plan on getting two minis for my greencheek conures. All bird toys should have this kind of
          stimulation. Wonderfully manufactured! Great Entertainment! We absolutely love them! Amazing job!

        <h3>Amazing musical toy</h3>
        <p>
          Great toy for birds who may be bored while their owners are away. The toy is simple to use and not intimidating. The best part is adding your own music for your birds to listen to. Easy set
          up and plug in which is a plus!

          Chilli my African Grey found the BeakBox great, he triggers it to entertain himself, and waits for a response from someone (good boy), this has stopped the periodic squawking (he didn't do
          it a lot, but hardly does it anymore now). We have only just started adding in extra songs/saying we want him to say after waiting to see how he reacted to it initially! he's picked up the
          chirping from it loves that sound!

          The BeakBox has been so fun to introduce our bird to. It's such a different type of toy for her to be able to activate and play with. We have it near one of her favorite foraging toys and
          it's fun to see her start some jams and then go back to foraging.

        <h3>Great for in-cage training & communicating with me!</h3>
        <p>
          Saro can be a little bit of a wildcard with guests, so we like to have people who are just getting to know her train her while she's in the cage until they've established trust and she's
          accepted them into the flock. I trained her to turn on the BeakBox for a reward, and it's a favorite activity with visitors to have them train her using the BeakBox! Once we started to
          self-isolate during the pandemic and were home more often, the BeakBox became a way for her to communicate with us without having to scream. When she wants her cage opened up or to start a
          training session, she'll start a song and I'll come over to give her a little bit of attention. It's a much more pleasant way of her communicating her needs than yelling for us!

      <details>
        <summary>Is BeakBox a good fit for my bird?</summary>
        <p>If your birds love music, then yes, absolutely! Our levers have been designed to work with any kind of beak or claws that have enough strength to pull or push it.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What BeakBox should I get?</summary>
        <p>BeakBox has 3 sizes - BeakBox Mini, BeakBox Standard, and BeakBox - Edition for Big Birds.</p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://shop.mybeakbox.com/products/beakbox">The BeakBox Medium</a> will perfectly fit medium-sized birds like Indian Ringnecks, Cockatiels, Amazon Parrots, Conures, Caiques,
          Green-Cheeked Parakeets, Small Cockatoos (eg. Galahs), Rainbow Lorikeets, Alexandrines, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have small-sized birds like Budgies, Finches, Cockatiels, or Canaries, <a href="https://shop.mybeakbox.com/products/beakbox-mini">BeakBox Mini</a> will be a perfect fit for you. We’ve
          redesigned our original BeakBox lever with smaller species in mind and 3D-print each of them from plant-based biodegradable plastic that is safe for birds.
        </p>
        <p>
          We recommend using <a href="https://shop.mybeakbox.com/products/beakbox-big-bird-edition">BeakBox for Big Birds</a> for birds like Large Cockatoos (e.g. Sulfur Crested), Macaws, African
          Grey, etc.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How safe is my BeakBox?</summary>
        <p>
          Safety is our top priority and we work hard to ensure our toys are safe for both birds and humans. BeakBoxes are designed to keep all wires and electrical components out of your bird’s reach
          behind strong stainless steel plating (BeakBox Standard, BeakBox - Edition for Big Birds) or plant-based plastic plating (BeakBox Mini), and all bird-operated components are designed to
          withstand the strongest bites from the most curious beaks.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Does BeakBox need to be plugged in?</summary>
        <p>
          Yes. The BeakBox doesn’t have a battery built in and is powered by a micro USB cable that needs to be plugged into a USB port (like your phone charger brick, USB power bank, or computer) to
          work.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How safe are the materials?</summary>
        <p>
          The only material your birds will have contact with while using their BeakBox is stainless steel and all electronics are hidden behind non-toxic New Zealand Grown Pinus radiata plywood, or
          plant-based plastic for the BeakBox Mini.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Does BeakBox contain any glue?</summary>
        <p>BeakBoxes only contain inert, cured glues and thermoplastic adhesives which are non-toxic to birds and humans.</p>
