  <h2>Meet the Team</h2>
  <p>
    BeakBox is brought to you by our talented team. We came together as part of our company’s internal innovation program, where staff are free to come up with awesome (and sometimes slightly crazy)
    ideas and then vote on and pursue the best ones.
  </p>

  <p>
    We're all technology professionals and have many years of experience building hardware and software products, as well as helping other people develop creative solutions for their challenges. We’ve
    been lucky enough to have had the time, advisors, backing to produce prototypes, and everything else we need to bring the BeakBox from a concept through to a complete product.
