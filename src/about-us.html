      <h2>Meet the team</h2>
      <p>
        BeakBox is brought to you by our talented team. We came together as part of our company’s internal innovation program, where staff are free to come up with awesome (and sometimes slightly
        crazy) ideas and then vote on and pursue the best ones.

      <details>
        <summary><p>Is BeakBox a good fit for my bird?</p></summary>
        <p>If your birds love music, then yes, absolutely! Our levers have been designed to work with any kind of beak or claws that have enough strength to pull or push it.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary><p>What BeakBox should I get?</p></summary>
        <p>BeakBox has 3 sizes - BeakBox Mini, BeakBox Standard, and BeakBox - Edition for Big Birds.</p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://shop.mybeakbox.com/products/beakbox">The BeakBox Medium</a> will perfectly fit medium-sized birds like Indian Ringnecks, Cockatiels, Amazon Parrots, Conures, Caiques,
          Green-Cheeked Parakeets, Small Cockatoos (eg. Galahs), Rainbow Lorikeets, Alexandrines, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have small-sized birds like Budgies, Finches, Cockatiels, or Canaries, <a href="https://shop.mybeakbox.com/products/beakbox-mini">BeakBox Mini</a> will be a perfect fit for you. We’ve
          redesigned our original BeakBox lever with smaller species in mind and 3D-print each of them from plant-based biodegradable plastic that is safe for birds.
        </p>
        <p>
          We recommend using <a href="https://shop.mybeakbox.com/products/beakbox-big-bird-edition">BeakBox for Big Birds</a> for birds like Large Cockatoos (e.g. Sulfur Crested), Macaws, African
          Grey, etc.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary><p>How safe is my BeakBox?</p></summary>
        <p>
          Safety is our top priority and we work hard to ensure our toys are safe for both birds and humans. BeakBoxes are designed to keep all wires and electrical components out of your bird’s reach
          behind strong stainless steel plating (BeakBox Standard, BeakBox - Edition for Big Birds) or plant-based plastic plating (BeakBox Mini), and all bird-operated components are designed to
          withstand the strongest bites from the most curious beaks.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary><p>Does BeakBox need to be plugged in?</p></summary>
        <p>
          Yes. The BeakBox doesn’t have a battery built in and is powered by a micro USB cable that needs to be plugged into a USB port (like your phone charger brick, USB power bank, or computer) to
          work.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary><p>How safe are the materials?</p></summary>
        <p>
          The only material your birds will have contact with while using their BeakBox is stainless steel and all electronics are hidden behind non-toxic New Zealand Grown Pinus radiata plywood, or
          plant-based plastic for the BeakBox Mini.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary><p>Does BeakBox contain any glue?</p></summary>
        <p>BeakBoxes only contain inert, cured glues and thermoplastic adhesives which are non-toxic to birds and humans.</p>
