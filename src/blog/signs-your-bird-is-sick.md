We all want to help our pets when they aren’t feeling well, but how do we help them if we can’t tell when they’re sick? [Birds are well known for ‘masking’ any signs of illness or injury to avoid being abandoned by the flock](https://currumbinvetservices.com.au/preservation-or-masking-reflex/ "https://currumbinvetservices.com.au/preservation-or-masking-reflex/ "). As a result it is often extremely difficult to distinguish between a bird that is tired and resting, and bird that is seriously unwell and in need of medical treatment. The following article will help you recognize when your pet needs help.

### Tail ‘bobbing’ or ‘dipping’

Tail bobbing is a sign of respiratory infection, as it indicates that the bird is experiencing labored breathing. As each breath takes a concerted effort and strains the lungs/abdomen of the bird, the tail is pulled forward and ‘dips’ with each exhalation. [There are many videos on the internet which demonstrate what tail bobbing looks like and how to recognize i](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=tail+bobbing "https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=tail+bobbing")t.

It is also important to study what your bird looks like when they are healthy and resting. This way, when something like tail bobbing occurs you will recognize it instantly as something that is not part of your birds normal healthy behavioral patterns.

If you do catch your bird’s tail dipping or bobbing, it is important to schedule a trip to the vet ASAP as colds, flu and other respiratory illness can be very serious. Antibiotics are a common treatment, and are usually given in powdered form and added to your birds drinking water.

### Lack of appetite

One of the most easily recognizable and common signs that your bird is unwell is lack of appetite. If you find most of your birds food is untouched then it might be a sign that they are in pain or unwell and unable to eat. It is especially concerning when your bird doesn’t appear interested in their favourite treats.

When your bird stops eating it is probably time for a trip to the vet, as this behaviour is not normal and can be a sign of very serious illness.

Other reasons your bird may not be eating include ‘food fatigue’ (maybe your pet is bored of having the same meal every day, and mental illness like depression (more details in the following section). However, it is nearly always best to play it safe and consult with a professional whenever your pet stops eating.

### Obsessive preening and/or feather plucking

Feather plucking is sign of mental distress and often associated with boredom, loneliness, and lack of enrichment. This is a very serious and destructive habit that is difficult to unlearn. You should spend time observing your bird to understand what triggers this behaviour and work to remove these triggers from provoking your bird. Possible triggers could be

- Lack of stimulus to chew and grind the beak on
- Depression or mental illness (often observed with lack of appetite)
- Loneliness (perhaps after the departure of a flock member, or from lack of contact time with their humans)
- Boredom

These triggers can usually be addressed with additional cognitive and physical enrichment. Keep your bird distracted from plucking and preening using interesting and fun toys that allow for chewing and biting. In addition, keep their mental wellbeing tip-top by spending plenty of quality time together and using foragers, BeakBox, and other cognitive enrichment tools to challenge their birdy brains.

As with all signs of stress or illness, feather plucking and/or obsessive preening is serious issue and definitely something to talk to your local vet about if you observe it happening to your pet.

### Extreme changes in mood

If your bird is experiencing drastic mood swings, or you can’t figure out why your pet has such a bad attitude, it might be a sign that they are in discomfort and are struggling to communicate that they need your help. Birds are well known for hiding any signs of illness from the flock, so their ailments are often invisible to us, meaning we have to watch closely for any changes in behaviour.

Be mindful that your bird will go through seasonal hormone changes which may produce mood swings. If your bird’s personality changes and you can’t figure out why, the first thing to check is whether it is the start of a new season, particularly one in which your bird would be mating, preparing to lay, or growing new feathers (as the new ‘pin’ feathers coming in will be itchy and uncomfortable).

Remember that your bird has feelings! Mood swings are common in birds as they are socially complex creatures known to experience and express emotions like happiness, heartbreak, anger and boredom.

### Sitting at the bottom of the cage

If your bird is no longer using perches and has started resting at the bottom of the cage, then it is time to take some immediate action and find a professional veterinarian to examine your pet. When your bird is not using it’s usual roosts it is likely that they have either fallen from a perch or are not strong enough to support themselves without risk of falling. Either way, this is a very serious sign of illness or injury and should be immediately acted upon.

### In general

You know your pet best, and it is ultimately up to you to decide what course of action is best when you suspect something is wrong with your bird. With this in mind, use common sense, reach out to your vet for advice (often over-the-phone consults are free and extremely helpful), and always err on the side of caution to avoid missing a diagnosis your bird is hiding from you.
