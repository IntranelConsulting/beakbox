As the temperatures drop, your feathered friend might appreciate something a little more comforting than the usual fruit and seed mix. This parrot-safe porridge is a warm, nutritious, and easy-to-make treat your bird will love - especially on chilly mornings.

Packed with fiber, this recipe is a great way to use up leftover veggies and keep your parrot’s meals interesting.

## What You'll Need:

- ½ cup oats
- ½ cup fresh fruit and veggies (or frozen corn, peas, or a mix)
- ¼ cup pellets (optional)
- ⅓ cup water

> Tip: Choose bird-safe fruits and veggies like apple (no seeds), grated carrot, sweetcorn, leafy greens, capsicum, or berries. Avoid avocado, onion, garlic, and any other toxic foods.

## Instructions In a Nutshell

1. **Chop or grate** the fruit and vegetables into small, manageable pieces. Grating can help create a smoother, more “porridge-like” consistency that many birds enjoy.
2. **Combine all ingredients** (oats, fruit/veggies, and pellets if using) in a microwave-safe bowl.
3. **Add ⅓ cup water**, then microwave on high for about 1 minute. _Alternatively, simmer gently on the stovetop until the oats are soft and fully cooked._
4. Let the porridge **cool for 2–3 minutes** before serving. You can also test the temperature with your finger to ensure it’s warm but not hot.

## Serving Ideas

- Top with a few fresh herbs or greens for enrichment.
- Offer as a bonding treat during morning routines.

## Storage Tip

Leftovers can be stored in the fridge for up to 2 days. Just warm slightly before serving again — but always discard uneaten portions after a few hours to prevent spoilage.

This porridge is a gentle, healthy way to offer variety in your bird’s diet — and it might even become a new cold-weather favorite. Give it a try and see how your parrot responds!
