          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "The concept is easy - the strong stainless steel lever activates music every time your bird presses or pulls it and the compact integrated speaker plays tunes you've uploaded onto your BeakBox. Your birds now can choose their favorite songs and play them whenever they want. How cool is that?"
