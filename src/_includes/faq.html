        <summary>Is BeakBox a good fit for my bird?</summary>
        <p>
          We've seen parrots of all ages, sizes, and species enjoying the BeakBox. Birds who take to the BeakBox most easily have two things in common: they love music and are open to new experiences.

        <summary>Will BeakBox work with my cage setup?</summary>
        <p>
          BeakBox can be installed on cages with both vertical and horizontal bars. However, if you tend to keep your cage open most of the time, BeakBox might not be a suitable choice, as it is
          important that your parrots do not interact with the wooden part of the toy.
