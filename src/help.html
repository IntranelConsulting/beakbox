      <details>
        <summary>Is BeakBox a good fit for my bird?</summary>
        <p>If your parrots are into music and open to trying new things, then yes, absolutely! We've seen parrots of all ages, sizes, and species enjoying their BeakBox.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What are BeakBoxes made of?</summary>
        <p>BeakBoxes are crafted using 100% bird-safe, non-toxic materials: wood and stainless steel.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What BeakBox should I get for my parrot?</summary>
        <p>BeakBox comes in two sizes: medium and large.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>BeakBox for Medium Birds: </strong>Built for medium-sized parrots like Indian Ringnecks, Conures, Caiques, Green-Cheeked Parakeets, Small Cockatoos (e.g., Galahs), Rainbow Lorikeets,
          Alexandrines, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>BeakBox for Large Birds: </strong>deal for the larger (and a tad more destructive) parrots such as Large Cockatoos (e.g., Sulfur-Crested Cockatoo), Macaws, African Grey, Amazon
          Parrots.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How safe is BeakBox?</summary>
        <p>
          Safety first, always! BeakBoxes are designed to keep all the electrical components—aka “the brains”—safely out of your parrot’s curious reach. And all bird-operated parts can handle the
          mightiest beak bites with ease. We even put them through the ultimate test with kea, the most destructive parrots in the world!
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Does BeakBox fit any bird cage?</summary>
        <p>BeakBox is best fitted to cages with vertical bars. If you have a cage with horizontal bars, you might need to rotate your BeakBox sideways to attach it to the cage.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Where are BeakBoxes made?</summary>
        <p>
          BeakBoxes are proudly made in New Zealand, a stunning land of kiwi and hundreds of other cool birds. Our team puts their heart into each one, manually assembling BeakBoxes to guarantee
          top-notch quality for both parrots and their awesome owners.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How safe are the materials?</summary>
        <p>The only material your birds will have contact with while using their BeakBox is stainless steel and all electronics are hidden behind non-toxic New Zealand Grown Pinus radiata plywood.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Do BeakBoxes come with a built-in battery?</summary>
        <p>Yes! BeakBoxes now come with a handy, built-in battery. You can charge your BeakBox using a USB Type-C cable (sold separately on our website).</p>
        <p>If you happen to have an older BeakBox with the micro USB port, please keep in mind you’ll still need to plug it in using a micro USB cable to make it work.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How do you charge your BeakBox?</summary>
        <p>
          Connect your BeakBox using a USB Type-C cable to a USB power source such as a USB wall adapter or a computer. Each BeakBox comes with some charge, but should be charged for 4-6 hours for a
          full battery.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How to factory reset your BeakBox?</summary>
        <p>Performing a factory reset will restore your BeakBox to its original factory-installed firmware, removing any installed firmware updates.</p>
        <p>To factory reset your BeakBox, ensure it is turned off. Then, press the POWER button while holding down the VOLUME UP button.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Can I change the volume on my BeakBox?</summary>
        <p>Yes, you can! Use volume controls (marked with + and -) on the human side of the BeakBox to turn the volume up or down.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What if my parrot doesn’t like or use the BeakBox?</summary>
        <p>
          No worries! We want both you and your feathered friend to be happy. If the BeakBox doesn't quite hit the right note for your parrot, we've got a 30-day money-back guarantee so you can return
          your BeakBox hassle-free. <a href="https://shop.mybeakbox.com/pages/returns-and-refunds">Check out the T&C</a> for the nitty-gritty details, but essentially, we've got your back!

      <h3>Installing BeakBox on your bird cage</h3>
      <p>Follow these steps to securely install the BeakBox on your bird cage:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Unscrew both thumb nuts from the BeakBox by rotating them anti-clockwise. Then remove the two bolts, each equipped with oval washers attached.</li>
        <li>Press the metal plate against the outside of the cage, ensuring the lever pokes inside between the bars. Check that the lever moves freely.</li>
        <li>
          Hold the BeakBox in place and reach into the cage to insert the bolts, with oval washers attached, into the top and bottom mounting holes. Then, screw thumb nuts onto the bolts. Ensure the
          oval washer is horizontal and firmly tighten.
        </li>
        <li>Press the power button to turn your BeakBox on; the power light should turn green.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="notecard flex-container-collapse">
        <img src="/imgs/warning-icon.svg" alt="">
        <p>Parrots are often wary of new toys, so we strongly recommend gradually introducing your birds to the BeakBox before attaching it to the cage and teaching them how to press the lever.
