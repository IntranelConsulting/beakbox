# BeakBox-Web

## Overview

This repository contains code for the BeakBox website. It is a static HTML/CSS/JS website hosted on Netlify.

For the firmware, go to the [Azure repository](https://intranelprojects.visualstudio.com/BeakBox/_git/BeakBox-Web)

## Contributing

The project is configured to integrate with the VS Code's Prettier extension. Install and enable this to the workspace (it isn't recommended you enable this extension globally). From there, all formatting should be handled on file save.

## Deployment Instructions

To run/test the website on a local web server first be sure to install the npm dependences - `npm install` and then use the `npm start` task.
